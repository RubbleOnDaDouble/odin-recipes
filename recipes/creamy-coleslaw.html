        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This easy coleslaw recipe is great for just about any occasionâ€”a weeknight dinner,
             a cookout, or a fun picnic lunch. Like all my favorite summer recipes, it is 
             packed with colorful veggies, and a lightly creamy, tangy dressing ties the 
             whole thing together. It comes together in minutes, and it keeps well if you 
             make it ahead of time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Cabbage - I use a mix of red and green cabbage, but just one will work here 
                too. To shred cabbage, thinly slice it with a sharp knife or mandoline</li>
            <li>Carrots - They add extra color and a light sweetness. Instead of shredding 
                the carrots on a box grater, use a vegetable peeler to slice them into thin 
                strips.</li>
            <li>Scallions - You will not find them in packaged coleslaw mix, but I love 
                their fresh, oniony flavor and green hue.</li>
            <li>Mayo - Make this recipe vegan by substituting store-bought or homemade 
                vegan mayo.</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar and Dijon mustard - They give the dressing tangy 
                depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Maple syrup - It balances the assertive mustard and vinegar.</li>
            <li>Celery seeds - These little guys give this coleslaw recipe delicious savory 
                flavor. If you do not have them on hand, they are worth investing in. 
                I love them in my deviled eggs, egg salad, and potato salad, too!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, make the dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, maple 
                syrup, celery seed, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. 
                Whisk until smooth!</li>
            <li>Then, combine the veggies. Add the scallions, red cabbage, green cabbage, 
                and carrot to a large bowl, and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Finally, mix it all together! Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture, 
                and toss to coat. Season to taste, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
