# odin-recipes

Odin recipes is a project that reviews and summarizes
all the skills and knowledge I have learned so far.

This includes basics on commonly used  git commands,
setting up git on local machine and other basic knowledge.

HTML5 basics have also been touched as well as command line
basics.
